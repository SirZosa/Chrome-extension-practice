# Chrome-extension-practice
It's a chrome extension the saves the urls of the active tabs or the inputs the user give created from the tutorials of scrimba but slightly improved by me in my opinion. It gets a better "remove" button and optimized code. 
In order to install this extension to chrome go to this url "chrome://extensions/", enable developer mode, select "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the files.
