# Chrome-extension-practice
It's a chrome extension created from the tutorials of scrimba but slightly improved in my opinion. It gets a better "remove" button and optimized code. 
In order to install this extension to chrome go to this url "chrome://extensions/", enable developer mode, select "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the files.
